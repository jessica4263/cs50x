        <h1 class="display-6 margin-titlefacttext"><b>The Fascinating World of Jellyfish</b></h1>
        <p class="justify margin-facttext">Jellyfish have been around for over 500 million years, making them one of the oldest living
            creatures on Earth. Unlike most animals, jellyfish do not have a brain, heart, or bones.
            They rely on a simple network of nerves located in their epidermis to sense their environment.
            Jellyfish are composed of 95% water, which allows them to be incredibly buoyant and to float
            effortlessly in the ocean currents. Some species can even glow in the dark, thanks to bioluminescence.
            This remarkable ability helps them attract prey and deter predators. Despite their delicate appearance,
            jellyfish can be formidable hunters, using their tentacles equipped with nematocysts (stinging cells)
            to paralyze and capture small fish and plankton.
