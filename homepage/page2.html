        <p class="justify margin-facttext">Ice cream, a beloved dessert enjoyed by millions worldwide, has a history that stretches back thousands of years.
            The earliest evidence of a frozen treat comes from ancient China around 200 BC, where a mixture of milk and rice
            was packed in snow to freeze. Fast forward to the 13th century, and Marco Polo is credited with bringing back
            to Italy a recipe resembling sherbet from his travels to the East. By the 17th century, ice cream had made its
            way to Europe, becoming a favorite among royalty and the wealthy. The first written recipe for ice cream in English
            appeared in the 18th century. Ice cream's popularity soared in America after the invention of hand-cranked ice cream
             churns and the establishment of the first ice cream parlor in New York City in 1776. Today, ice cream comes in
             countless flavors and variations, from classic vanilla to exotic combinations, making it a universal treat.
