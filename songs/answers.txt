After calculating the average from energy(0.65906), danceability(0.71646) and valence(0.048443)
i can deduce that if the highest numer 1.0 is that the aura of this listener is pretty calm
with some danceable songs but not that high energy songs for a party or something like that.

A better way of calculating this value could be maybe integrating the genre of the artist that where
most listened and maybe to categorize prior the songs to this kind of caracteristics to have a more
representative aproach.
