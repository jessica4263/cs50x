#### Description:
My project is a web application named Task Manager that allows users to create lists and write tasks. The goal was to design the user interface and that meant writing the CSS from scratch, to ensure a unique and personalized look. I began by sketching different HTML templates on paper and outlining the routes needed in my app.py file. I then used Photoshop to design these templates, providing a base to apply my CSS effectively. I also designed my own logo and the image for the apology.html page in Photoshop.
In the project folder, the static folder contains the logo, the apology template image, and the CSS file. The templates folder includes all the HTML pages needed for navigating the Task Manager application. The app.py file holds all the routes for the application, and the project.db database has three tables to keep track of users, lists, and tasks.
The application begins at the login page, where users can either log in or register. Upon registration, the userâ€™s information is saved in the users table in project.db, with the user ID used to link lists and tasks to the specific user. If a user enters an incorrect username or nothing at all, the Apology function renders an apology HTML page with an appropriate error message.
After logging in, users are directed to their homepage, which displays all their created lists. The index route renders all lists in a preview card format, showing the first few tasks and the list's color. Users can edit or delete a list directly from these preview cards. To create a new list, users click the "+" button, enter a title, and select a color. This information is then inserted into the lists table in the database, creating a new entry with a unique list ID, color, date, and title.
Editing a list involves clicking the "edit" button, which loads the edit.html page displaying the list name and existing tasks. Users can add new tasks via an input box; when a new task is entered and the "+" button is clicked, the task is inserted into the tasks table with a unique task ID, linked to the corresponding list ID.
Users can delete tasks by clicking the "x" button next to each task, sending the task ID and list ID to the delete_task route, which removes the specific task from the database.
To delete an entire list, users must confirm their action. When a delete request is made, the application renders the delete.html page, asking for user confirmation. Once confirmed, the delete route removes all tasks associated with the list ID and user ID and then deletes the list from the lists table. This step ensures that users do not accidentally delete important data.
The application also includes a logout route, which clears the session, allowing another user to register or log in.
One of the most challenging aspects of this project was ensuring that the tasks table accurately updated when task checkboxes were checked or unchecked. This feature required a system for tracking the state of each task, ensuring that this state persisted across sessions and or refreshing. I accomplished this by implementing a checkbox column in the tasks table with a default Boolean value, updated through the update_task route whenever a checkbox state changed.
A special feature of Task Manager is the ability to change the color of a list as many times as desired. Users simply click "change color," select a new color, and this information is sent to the change route, updating the color in the lists table. The application uses Jinja templating and CSS to ensure that the new color is dynamically applied to the HTML, providing an immediate and visually consistent update.
